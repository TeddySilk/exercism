# Exercism
My solutions to [exercism](exercism.org) practice problems. My exercism profile can be found [here](https://exercism.org/profiles/SilkySeaman), with what published solutions I might have done. A lot of Python practice problems were made using exercism's online editor, and this repository will only contain solutions to problems made after a certain point. In other words, my published solutions on exercism contains about 40 more solutions than this repository.

# Tracks
I am currently working on the Python track primarily, but intend to practice Fortran as well.
